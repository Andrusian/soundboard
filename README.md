This is a soundboard design based on Teensy 2.0++. It can be easily adapted to an Arduino with enough I/O pins.

See pin diagram in the comments. There are:
16 momentary buttons
6 latched buttons (so far)
2 LEDs

This can also be a USB keyboard with minor code changes as Teensy supports USB HID protocol.
